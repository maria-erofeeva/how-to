# Learn how to learn

A project for those who want learning to be easy. For those who want just to find new life hacks to optimise their learning hours. 
For those who delay too long all important projects until the last moment and want to fix it (and for those who are worried about it).

The page contains 9 blocks. Each of them will bring you something useful (from a selection of YouTube videos to theory about teaching techniques).

Plans: to add interactive blocks.
